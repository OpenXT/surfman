Please this before any modification in surfman API.

Surfman API is currently in version 2. When you want
to modify a structure to add new callbacks
    1) Add them at the end of the structure in surfman-head.in;
    2) Bump the minor/macro version number (version-minor, version-major);
    3) Update surfman according the modification.

Some ideas for a version 3 of the API:
    - Add private field to store plugin's data;
    - Split plugin structure in 2: one part for the callbacks, the
    other for the data;
    - Modify all callbacks according to the previous item.
